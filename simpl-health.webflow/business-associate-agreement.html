              <p>a. Notify Business Associate of any limitation(s) in its notice of privacy practices in accordance with 45 CFR §164.520, to the extent that such limitation may affect Business Associate’s use or disclosure of PHI.</p>

              <p>c. Notify Business Associate of any restriction to the use or disclosure of PHI that Covered Entity has agreed to in accordance with 45 CFR §164.522, to the extent that such restriction may affect Business Associate’s use or disclosure of PHI.</p>
              <p>d. Except for data aggregation or management and administrative activities of Business Associate, Covered Entity shall not request Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner that would not be permissible under HIPAA if done by Covered Entity and shall comply with the Privacy Rule or applicable federal and state laws in connection with Covered Entity’s use and/or disclosure of PHI.</p>
              <p><strong>14. Data Ownership. </strong>Business Associate’s data stewardship under this Agreement does not confer data ownership rights on Business Associate with respect to any data shared with it under the Agreement, including any and all forms thereof.</p>
              <p><strong>15. Term and Termination</strong></p>
              <p>a. This BAA will become effective on the date first written above, and will continue in effect until all obligations of the Parties have been met under the Agreement and under this BAA.</p>
              <p>b. Covered Entity may terminate immediately this BAA, the Agreement, and any other related agreements if Covered Entity makes a determination that Business Associate has breached a material term of this BAA and Business Associate has failed to cure that material breach, to Covered Entity’s reasonable satisfaction, within thirty (30) days after written notice from Covered Entity. Covered Entity may report the problem to the Secretary of HHS if termination is not feasible.</p>
              <p>c. If Business Associate determines that Covered Entity has breached a material term of this BAA, then Business Associate will provide Covered Entity with written notice of the existence of the breach and shall provide Covered Entity with 30 days to cure the breach. Covered Entity’s failure to cure the breach within the 30-day period will be grounds for immediate termination of the Agreement and this BAA by Business Associate. Business Associate may report the breach to HHS. </p>
              <p>d. Upon termination of the Agreement or this BAA for any reason, all PHI maintained by Business Associate will be returned to Covered Entity or destroyed by Business Associate. Business Associate will not retain any copies of such information. This provision will apply to PHI in the possession of Business Associate’s agents and subcontractors. If return or destruction of the PHI is not feasible, in Business Associate’s reasonable judgment, Business Associate will furnish Covered Entity with notification, in writing, of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Parties that return or destruction of the PHI is infeasible, Business Associate will extend the protections of this BAA to such information for as long as Business Associate retains such information and will limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return or destruction of the information not feasible. The Parties understand that this Section 15(d) will survive any termination of this BAA.</p>
              <p><strong>16. Effect of BAA</strong></p>
              <p>a. This BAA is a part of and subject to the terms of the Agreement, except that to the extent any terms of this BAA conflict with any term of the Agreement, the terms of this BAA will govern.</p>
              <p>b. Except as expressly stated in this BAA or as provided by law, this BAA will not create any rights in favor of any third party.</p>
              <p><strong>17. Regulatory References</strong>. A reference in this BAA to a section in HIPAA means the section as in effect or as amended at the time.</p>
              <p><strong>18. Notices</strong>. All notices, requests and demands or other communications to be given under this BAA to a Party will be made via either first class mail, registered or certified or express courier, or electronic mail to the Party’s address given below:</p>
              <p>(a) If to Covered Entity, to the contact information set forth in the Service Order or Master Services Agreement, as the case may be.</p>
              <p>(b) If to Business Associate, to:</p>

              <p><strong>19. Amendments and Waiver</strong>. This BAA may not be modified, nor will any provision be waived or amended, except in writing duly signed by authorized representatives of the Parties. A waiver with respect to one event shall not be construed as continuing, or as a bar to or waiver of any right or remedy as to subsequent events. </p>
              <p><strong>20. HITECH Act Compliance</strong>. The Parties acknowledge that the HITECH Act includes significant changes to the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule. The privacy subtitle of the HITECH Act sets forth provisions that significantly change the requirements for business associates and the agreements between business associates and covered entities under HIPAA and these changes may be further clarified in forthcoming regulations and guidance. Each Party agrees to comply with the applicable provisions of the HITECH Act and any HHS regulations issued with respect to the HITECH Act. The Parties also agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this BAA as reasonably necessary to comply with the HITECH Act and its regulations as they become effective but, in the event that the Parties are unable to reach agreement on such a modification, either Party will have the right to terminate this BAA upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the other Party.</p>
